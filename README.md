Guide on how to prepare for AWS SAA-C01(Solutions Architect Associate exam)


This guide is about my journey while I was preparing for AWS SAA-C01 certification exam. I am still at initial stage but thinking that I will complete the course and try to finish the exam by the end of Aug, 2019. 

Study is divided into 2 parts:

# 1. Theory:
For theory part, I am going through a lot of documents and courses just to be confident enough before sitting for teh exam.
Listing the courses that I took. Courses are of two types:

# A. Free:

a. AWS Concepts by Linux Academy(https://www.udemy.com/aws-concepts/learn/practice/1096138?start=start-page#content)

b. AWS Essentials 2019 by Linux Academy(https://www.udemy.com/linux-academy-aws-essentials-2019/learn/lecture/13741530?start=420#overview)

c. Learn Amazon Web Services (AWS): The complete introduction   by LevelUpCloud(https://www.udemy.com/learn-amazon-web-services-the-complete-introduction/)

e. Mind maps of AWS services -- https://github.com/gitvani/aws-mindmap 

You can also go through some other free courses to get more idea before buying any courses

# B. Paid: 
In paid courses Ryan's courses are just well made. 



# 2. Practice:
This has two parts. 
# A. Reading FAQ & whitepapers
FAQ of all the services and core services covers 50% questions in the exam. That's right. And whitepapers are important before start practicing the test. 

FAQ: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/?ref=docs_gateway

Whitepaper: https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/?nc2=h_sol_use_rm

Best option is to go through FAQ + whitepapers + test while you are already well versed with the AWS services. 

# B. Practice test solving
  Here you can go through the practice tests given in Udemy, Whizlabs, awspro academy and braincert. The mentioned sites provide better quality practice tests and a littl below to the level of oroginal SAA exam. 
  
  whizlabs: https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-solutions-architect-associate/
  
  awspro academy: https://awspro.academy/
  
  braincert: https://www.braincert.com/bc/our-platform
  
  
  If you ask me to divide the whole concepts into groups, below are my groups:
  
  1. Netowrking/Infrastructure 
  2. Storage
  3. Database
  4. Security
  5. Access management
  6. Compute
  7. Others
  
  You need little knowledge but more clarity to master these concepts. Sit and please read all the details I provide with the help of efforts of many others whose contents I have read and clear the doubts of my own.
  
#  1. Networking: 
  
  This section has important services that Amazon is giving. Like Availability zones, aws regions, Edge locations, cloud delivery network. VPC is another part of it.
  Under VPC,  there has - private subnets, public subnets, Network Access Control Lists(NACLs), Route Table, Internet Gateway.
  
  Also Route 53, Auto scaling, and Load balancing - are very important topic to cover. 
  
  # Note: High availability and fault tolerance is mainly acgieved with the help of multiple availability zones with VPC. 
  
#  2. Storage: 
    Its about S3 mainly? No no. Its about Buckets and objects that you put in it. then you have storage classes. Mainly it is used based on the frequency level. 
  
  Object has a lifecycle. And permissions and versioning. You need to know both to master S3.
  
#  3. Database: 
    Has two categories: Relational(SQL or RDS) and Non relational(No-SQL or DynamoDB). Here understand provisioning an RDS instance and SSH tunneling.
  
#  4. Security: This is big and needs to be covered in layer by layer.
  
#  5. Access management: 
  Well verse yourself with IAM tool.
  
#  6. Compute: 
  EC2, instance types, EBS volumes, security groups. IP addressing, EC2 provissioning.
  
#  7. Others: 
  Multiple tools such as CloudWatch, SNS, SQS, SWS, CloudTrail etc.
