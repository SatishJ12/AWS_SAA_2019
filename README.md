Guide on how to prepare for AWS SAA-C01


This guide is about my journey while I was preparing for AWS SAA-C01 certification exam. I am still at initial stage but thinking that I will complete the course and try to finish the exam by the end of Aug, 2019. 

Study is divided into 2 parts:

# 1. Theory:
For theory part, I am going through a lot of documents and courses just to be confident enough before sitting for teh exam.
Listing the courses that I took. Courses are of two types:

# A. Free:
AWS Concepts by Linux Academy(https://www.udemy.com/aws-concepts/learn/practice/1096138?start=start-page#content)
AWS Essentials 2019 by Linux Academy(https://www.udemy.com/linux-academy-aws-essentials-2019/learn/lecture/13741530?start=420#overview)

# B. Paid: 
In paid courses Ryan's courses are just well made. 



# 2. Practice:
This has two parts. 
# A. Reading FAQ & whitepapers
FAQ of all the services and core services covers 50% questions in the exam. That's right. And whitepapers are important before start practicing the test. 
FAQ: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/?ref=docs_gateway

Best option is to go through FAQ + whitepapers + test while you are already well versed with the AWS services.
